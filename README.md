# Algorithms of geographic indices: Location, flow, and subregions.
* The code for the spatial analysis of Inteurban mobility includes the identification of hot spots in location analysis, the identification of key channels in flow direction analysis, the division of subregions and the calculation of potential energy values. This method addresses the oversight and limited geographic information in previous flow space research employing network analysis methods.
